- 👋 Hi! 
    I’m @silvanic or Alexandre (Alex if it's too long for you ^^). 
    
  I'm primarly a fullstack developer (i mostly study Java/Python/Javascript/PHP/SQL in my study) but I discover NodeJS in 2019 and i kind of love it so I try to focus more on that technology. 
    
    Why did I fell in love with NodeJS (i can say javascript too)? 
    
    Probably JSON and callback function, yeah mostly that. It's pretty dumb, i know. But loading an object with something like "JSON.parse(***)" and here you go! You have your object, I found it fascinating (even though in Java,
    there is serialization/deserialization, but it was not really "natural" for me). What about callback? Who don't like to write anonymous function as a parameter !

    
    
    
- 👀 I’m interested in NodeJS, Vue, Angular, CSS (framework and vanilla), Phaser 3 (mostly Javascript indeed!:) )
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue 3 as well as its environment
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some projets, could be Front/Back... I'm pretty curious so open my mind (it's a little mess ahah) !
- 📫 How to reach me ? Well, right here will be a good start ahah
